# COJTaxData
Script to Retrieve Public Data from City of Jacksonville Tax Assessor Website

These script were written for some research into Historic Springfield, but may be usedful to others as well.

Please be concious of the number of requests you are sending to the COJ website. This is why I split this into two parts:

1) Script to retrieve the data
2) Script to parse the data
