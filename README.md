# COJTaxData
Script to Retrieve Public Data from City of Jacksonville Tax Assessor Website

These script were written for some research into Historic Springfield, but may be usedful to others as well.

Please be concious of the number of requests you are sending to the COJ website. This is why all HTML pages retrieved are cached in the "Data" directory, so they only have to be pulled once.

The "etc" directory includes a database schema (cojdata.schema) as well as sample data (cojdata.sql.gz). Both are for use with MySQL.
