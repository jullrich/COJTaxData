Realestate numbers:

The "unique index" for the data is a "Realestate Number" or short "RE". It uses the format \d{6}-\d{4}. The first part is often refered to as RE6 and the second part as RE4. The second part is sometimes used to identify subparcels, or "logical parcels" that are used to better define tax exemptions (e.g. historic exemption)
